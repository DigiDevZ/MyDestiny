# MyDestiny
MyDestiny is a Destiny 2 companion app project that I have been working on.

## NO LONGER WORKING ON THIS PROJECT AS OF 2018

## Current build of project
  * 0.9.1

## App Features
  * User can login with their destiny 2 account to see their characters and inventories.
  * Items can be transferred around the characters or to the vault.


## Technology behind the app
  * Frameworks the app uses:
    * OAuthSwift
    * SwiftKeychainWrapper
    * SQLite.swift
    * Zip (Looking into phasing this out for a more suitable zipping framework.)


  The app uses OAuth authentication (2.0), around 10+ API endpoints from the Destiny 2 API, and a manifest for a database stored locally.

## Features in the works
  * Cleaner UI
  * Constraining properly.
  * Logging out
  * Expand on the vault screen
  * More to come

## Project history
  * Completed version 0.9.1 in 3 weeks, first time using OAuth, interacting with massive API that has ~200 endpoints, first time storing and unzipping database manifest locally on device.
